# NCC_3D_ALPHA
The program was created with the support of the National Cancer Center.

The program was written on the advice of Yuh-Seog Jung, Jungirl Seok, boyul hwang medical doctor.

Thank you for doctors.

There is a 3d slice program that has been refined and built for 20 years with support from the US National Medical Agency. 
However, it is not easy to understand even though it is open source due to various converged technologies.
The NCC_3D_ALPA program is an easy-to-understand program that even undergraduate students can understand using only the Python language.
The NCC_3D_ALPA program was created to provide hints and easy access methods to those who want to make their own programs such as 3D slice programs.

Create a ROI 2D image with the NCC BETA program here and show the 3D object 
as a screenshot on the screen with the 3D tool.

This program is based on VTK and
"If the 2D image conforms to the format of VTK in order, it can operate independently" 
and an object-oriented design pattern is applied.

I am currently working on another project, so the support of NCC_3D_ALPA ends here.
